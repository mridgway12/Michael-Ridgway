  <h3><font face="lato" color="#blue" size="5">Interest In IT:</h3>
  <p3><font face="lato" color="#blue" size="5">My interest in IT started at 7 years of age, through gaming with Duke Nukem 3D. I was compelled to explore every possible secret and Easter Egg possible, on top of playing the game for what it is. <br>From there, I was trying to download games online, as well as music from Limewire, which resulted in my parents’ computer riddled with viruses. I had to know how and (literally) why this happened, and how I personally could fix it. I was then obsessed with all things IT and started teaching myself the basics through YouTube and gaming. <br>When playing a game, I need to understand the fundamentals of all the commands, how they trigger responses in the games, and why all of this occurs. 
  I have chosen to study at RMIT as I believe it is a leading university for IT progression and upcoming technology advancements. <br>I believe attending a university that is ‘ranked in the top 10 universities in Australia for studies in IT’ (RMIT University, 2022), is crucial for developing my skills and knowledge. The fact RMIT is ‘number one in Australia for graduate employment rate’ (RMIT University, 2022), was also extremely appealing in being the university of my choice. 
  <br>During my studies with RMIT I expect to learn how to appropriately use Github, learn programming and developing software, learn how to use all the languages related to coding and exactly how they all work and implement with one another. Along with all of this, I hope to learn and retain all the fundamentals in relation to Information Technologies, including how it all began, advanced website and application developments, how robots are created and commanded to commit to tasks, etc. while studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. </h3>
  <h3><font face="lato" color="#blue" size="5">My Ideal Job:</h3>
  <p3><font face="lato" color="#blue" size="5">The ideal job I have chosen is a Lead Software Developer/Team Leader at a company called 
Patient Zero, as I have the goal to become a world-class software developer and 
programmer. As a team leader in this job role, you are expected to be proactive, have an 
influence on architecture decisions and propose solutions for the built products, as well as 
creating a thriving and collaborative work environment for your team. It is crucial to enjoy 
the many aspects of software development and educate peers on software quality. Paid 
certifications in the partnership programs at Patient Zero, as well flexible working
arrangements with working from home and the office make this job appealing and 
attractive to me.
This job is also attractive to me due to not only seeing the team environment of friendly and 
fun people, who have the same sense of humour as myself, as shown on the Seek job 
advertisement and in the Youtube video; Working at Patient Zero - YouTube, but also due to 
the fact the job offers a ‘bunch of learning groups & a personal growth planning programs to 
advance your career’ (Patient Zero. Seek, 2022). The opportunity to work in a smaller team 
environment of 4/5, opposed to a complete office setting is also what attracted me to the 
job, as I find smaller teams and office settings more relaxing and enjoyable. I believe this 
would allow me to focus and invest all the knowledge I retain into the job, removing small 
distractions and ensuring the required skills are being utilised. 
The skills required in this job role are extensive programming knowledge, the ability to work 
with numerous tools used for coding (including TypeScript and C#) and knowing different 
coding languages, working on cloud base networks (including Azure, AWS and GCP), 
leadership qualities and mentoring peers. The leadership qualities and skills to mentor peers 
are not new skills to me, having previously being employed as a Team Leader for St George 
Bank. In this previous job, I was responsible for a team of 20 other staff members, 
mentoring them in all the aspects of customer service, being their leader in the job role and 
teaching them how to navigate the software used. This job advertisement does not state 
any needed qualifications, but is clear what knowledge is expected. While the expected 
knowledge of extensive programming, coding applications and languages, along with cloud 
base networks are not yet extensively known to me, I plan to achieve this through studying 
a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, continuing onto a Master’s degree.

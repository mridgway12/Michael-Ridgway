  <h3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">Interest In IT:</h3>
  <p3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">My interest in IT started at 7 years of age, through gaming with Duke Nukem 3D. I was compelled to explore every possible secret and Easter Egg possible, on top of playing the game for what it is. <br>From there, I was trying to download games online, as well as music from Limewire, which resulted in my parents’ computer riddled with viruses. I had to know how and (literally) why this happened, and how I personally could fix it. I was then obsessed with all things IT and started teaching myself the basics through YouTube and gaming. <br>When playing a game, I need to understand the fundamentals of all the commands, how they trigger responses in the games, and why all of this occurs. 
  I have chosen to study at RMIT as I believe it is a leading university for IT progression and upcoming technology advancements. <br>I believe attending a university that is ‘ranked in the top 10 universities in Australia for studies in IT’ (RMIT University, 2022), is crucial for developing my skills and knowledge. The fact RMIT is ‘number one in Australia for graduate employment rate’ (RMIT University, 2022), was also extremely appealing in being the university of my choice. 
  <br>During my studies with RMIT I expect to learn how to appropriately use Github, learn programming and developing software, learn how to use all the languages related to coding and exactly how they all work and implement with one another. Along with all of this, I hope to learn and retain all the fundamentals in relation to Information Technologies, including how it all began, advanced website and application developments, how robots are created and commanded to commit to tasks, etc. while studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. </h3>
  <h3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">My Ideal Job:</h3>
  <p3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">The ideal job I have chosen is a Lead Software Developer/Team Leader at a company called 
Patient Zero, as I have the goal to become a world-class software developer and 
programmer. As a team leader in this job role, you are expected to be proactive, have an 
influence on architecture decisions and propose solutions for the built products, as well as 
creating a thriving and collaborative work environment for your team. It is crucial to enjoy 
the many aspects of software development and educate peers on software quality. Paid 
certifications in the partnership programs at Patient Zero, as well flexible working
arrangements with working from home and the office make this job appealing and 
attractive to me.
This job is also attractive to me due to not only seeing the team environment of friendly and 
fun people, who have the same sense of humour as myself, as shown on the Seek job 
advertisement and in the Youtube video; Working at Patient Zero - YouTube, but also due to 
the fact the job offers a ‘bunch of learning groups & a personal growth planning programs to 
advance your career’ (Patient Zero. Seek, 2022). The opportunity to work in a smaller team 
environment of 4/5, opposed to a complete office setting is also what attracted me to the 
job, as I find smaller teams and office settings more relaxing and enjoyable. I believe this 
would allow me to focus and invest all the knowledge I retain into the job, removing small 
distractions and ensuring the required skills are being utilised. 
The skills required in this job role are extensive programming knowledge, the ability to work 
with numerous tools used for coding (including TypeScript and C#) and knowing different 
coding languages, working on cloud base networks (including Azure, AWS and GCP), 
leadership qualities and mentoring peers. The leadership qualities and skills to mentor peers 
are not new skills to me, having previously being employed as a Team Leader for St George 
Bank. In this previous job, I was responsible for a team of 20 other staff members, 
mentoring them in all the aspects of customer service, being their leader in the job role and 
teaching them how to navigate the software used. This job advertisement does not state 
any needed qualifications, but is clear what knowledge is expected. While the expected 
knowledge of extensive programming, coding applications and languages, along with cloud 
base networks are not yet extensively known to me, I plan to achieve this through studying 
a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, continuing onto a Master’s degree.</p3>
    <h3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">Personal profile:</h3>
    <p3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">The results from the Myers-Briggs mean to me that I am very analytic and love to debate. 
These match with the results from the Big 5 Personality Test, which shows I score low in 
agreeableness. The online learning style test is accurate with the way I was taught in school, 
through visual aids. I find having visual aids, such as a graph extremely beneficial. Being an 
extravert, as shown in the Myers-Briggs results and the Big 5 Personality Test results, I 
believe I make a strong team leader, and thorough problem solver which will benefit me in a 
team. These results will influence my behaviour in a team in being the first to put my hand 
up and break the ice, as well as wanting to be the first to complete the workload. When 
forming a team, I believe these tests results should be considered. I believe two debaters 
can be better than one, as a debate can get down to the core issue, having members of the 
      team bouncing ideas and solutions off one another until the most beneficial one is created</p3>
      <h3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">Project Idea:</h3>
      <p3><font face="lato" color="#000080" size="5">Overview: My project idea is a smartphone and computer application that users in the animal 
industry, including veterinary clinics; boarding kennels; groomers; trainers and day-care facilities can 
use to log on and check a household animals’ veterinary history. This includes all relevant 
vaccination information, medications, and behaviours. This application will be developed using MIT 
App Inventor and accessible to those using iPhones, Androids and tablets. There is currently no 
similar application for users in this industry to remotely check veterinary history without having all
the relevant paperwork or a phone call to a veterinary clinic. This application will essentially be a My
Health Record for animals, saving time for all users, as well as saving the environment eliminating 
paper usage. 
Motivation: The motivation behind my project idea stems from knowing how crucial a pet’s
veterinary history, especially vaccination status is for boarding and day-care facilities. A current 
vaccination is the main requirement when checking in to a boarding facility, and often the most 
forgotten about part by an owner. Having an application which can only be logged on by those in the 
animal industry, can not only avoid any arising conflict between staff and owners, but also save time, 
and ensure all important details are passed on to those who require it. This can assist to avoid wait 
times, and ensure no pets are at risk of catching deadly diseases. 
Description: This application would be used by a registered business in the animal industry. Simply 
searching details including the microchip number of the animal, owner’s address or phone number 
will allow the user to sight all veterinary history. This allows the user to ensure they know exactly 
how to care for and treat the animal. The application will also allow the user to add any relevant 
information, such as the animal’s temperament towards staff and other animals while boarding, 
whether the animal ate their food, jumps fences and incident reports. This will then allow the 
veterinary practice in knowing all details for appointments after boarding (such as if the pet refused 
to eat, was injured or in a fight), and if an emergency was to occur. If an animal needed to be rushed 
to the emergency veterinary clinic, this will assist the staff in gathering all details. Often, owners are 
stressed, upset and scared when having to go to the emergency clinic and details can be forgotten 
among the way. This application will ensure nothing important is missed or forgotten by the owners.
While the application will be used to ensure things are not missed or forgotten, obstacles may occur.
These obstacles include important details not being immediately uploaded, clinics not having the 
staff available to upload details on to the application, internet connection issues, privacy leaks and 
application errors. Constant updates on the application would be needed to remove any obstacles 
with errors, along with a firewall to combat any privacy leaks and prevent hackers and pet owners 
from accessing the application/database. If the user does not have current internet, the application 
saves all information that the user wishes to upload and has a feature to automatically upload when 
the connection is once again strong. The application users voice to text, allowing staff members to 
utilize this feature and save time. Another obstacle that may occur is the facility not having access to 
the microchip number of the animal. This is combated by allowing the user to enter other details 
including the species, breed and name of the animal, along with the owner’s address, email address, 
mobile number, date of birth and drivers license number. 
Working at a boarding kennel, I know how important this application will be for the animal industry. 
Owners do not like to admit negative attributes in their dogs, such as if they will jump fences, if they 
are social to other animals and people, and if they have or have not been vaccinated. Having all
these details through an application that shows the attributes and history assist the animal care 
workers in ensuring the animal receives the best possible care that they can, that the individual 
animal is safe, as well as the staff and other animals. Knowing from a previous boarding kennel if an 
animal can jump over fences prior to boarding allows the kennel to assign the dog into a suitable 
room and yard. Not having every needed detail about the animal can be detrimental to the business, 
and this application can ensure the best for all involved. 
Tools and Technologies: MIT App Inventor will be used to create the application. MIT App Inventor is 
a ‘free, cloud-based service that allows you to make your own mobile apps’ (MIT App Inventor, 
2022). Using MIT App Inventor is the quickest way to create the application for a first-time app 
creator, allowing users to have a ‘simple first app up and running in less than 30 minutes’ (MIT App 
Inventor, 2022). A strong internet connection is also required, as a web browser is needed to use the 
App Inventor. Once the application is made, users will need to have either an iPhone, Android or 
Tablet in order to access the application remotely and whenever needed. Users will also need 
internet connection to upload all relevant information.
Skills Required: To create this application through MIT App Inventor, experience in a blocks-based 
programming language is required, as well as knowledge on using a computer and the internet. Also 
needed to create this application, is experience in the animal industry, knowing exactly what details 
are needed to go into the application by those uploading details. As this application is being created 
by the MIT App Inventor tool, there is not a wide variety of Information Technology skills required to 
create the application. 
Outcome: The outcome of a successful application will assist all of those in the animal care industry 
knowing exactly how to care for, as well as medicate, household pets. This application will also save 
time for those needing vaccine details, eliminating the need to phone a vet, as well as save paper by 
no longer needing to have a printed vaccine copy. This application will also give owners a peace of 
mind, knowing all their pets’ details are given to only those who require it, ensuring the utmost care 
        is given, as well as knowing all important details are not forgotten.</p3>

  <h3><font face="lato" color="#green" size="5">Interest In IT:</h3>
  <p3><font face="lato" color="#green" size="5">My interest in IT started at 7 years of age, through gaming with Duke Nukem 3D. I was compelled to explore every possible secret and Easter Egg possible, on top of playing the game for what it is. <br>From there, I was trying to download games online, as well as music from Limewire, which resulted in my parents’ computer riddled with viruses. I had to know how and (literally) why this happened, and how I personally could fix it. I was then obsessed with all things IT and started teaching myself the basics through YouTube and gaming. <br>When playing a game, I need to understand the fundamentals of all the commands, how they trigger responses in the games, and why all of this occurs. 
  I have chosen to study at RMIT as I believe it is a leading university for IT progression and upcoming technology advancements. <br>I believe attending a university that is ‘ranked in the top 10 universities in Australia for studies in IT’ (RMIT University, 2022), is crucial for developing my skills and knowledge. The fact RMIT is ‘number one in Australia for graduate employment rate’ (RMIT University, 2022), was also extremely appealing in being the university of my choice. 
  <br>During my studies with RMIT I expect to learn how to appropriately use Github, learn programming and developing software, learn how to use all the languages related to coding and exactly how they all work and implement with one another. Along with all of this, I hope to learn and retain all the fundamentals in relation to Information Technologies, including how it all began, advanced website and application developments, how robots are created and commanded to commit to tasks, etc. while studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. </h3>
